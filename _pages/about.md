About Me
======
  I am a 27-year-old third-year Computer Science student with a strong passion for programming and
software development. So far, I have gained hands-on experience in backend development, web
development, mobile app development, and database management using technologies such as Laravel,
.NET, C/C++, Java, and Android Studio with Kotlin. I am a fast learner, naturally curious, and eager to
explore new tools, frameworks, and methodologies.
  I am especially interested in practical opportunities where I can work on real-world projects, gain insight
into the full software development lifecycle, and grow with the support of experienced professionals. I am
enthusiastic, adaptable, and always seeking challenges that help me develop both personally and
professionally.
