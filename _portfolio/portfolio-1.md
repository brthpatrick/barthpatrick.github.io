This project, titled **“Local Farmers’ Market”**, is the main focus of my **bachelor’s thesis**.  
It was developed in both **C#** (desktop version) and **Kotlin** (Android mobile version).  

The goal of the application is to **connect local farmers with consumers**, making it easier for users to discover and purchase fresh, locally produced goods directly from small producers.  

Through this project, I aimed to:
- Support and promote **local agriculture and sustainability**  
- Provide a **user-friendly platform** with product listings, farmer profiles, and location-based search  
- Gain practical experience in **cross-platform development** and database integration  

The project reflects my passion for combining technology with real-world community impact.
