This project explores the combination of **artificial intelligence** and **interactive web development**.  
I created an **AI-driven escape room application** built with **Laravel**, where the system dynamically generates both the **room environment** and the **puzzles** based on user preferences.

The main features include:
- AI-generated escape room scenarios with unique challenges each time  
- Intelligent task generation using natural language prompts and logic constraints  
- A responsive, user-friendly **web interface** developed in **Laravel (PHP)**  
- Player progress tracking and adaptive puzzle difficulty  

The goal of the project is to merge creativity and technology — creating a **smart, replayable gaming experience** that adapts to the player’s actions.  
It also helped me deepen my understanding of **AI integration, backend architecture**, and **interactive web design**.
